{"Announcements": "\u003ccolor=lightblue\u003eJuly 26th, 2025 - Welcome to our Alpha Demo!\u003c/color\u003e\n\nThis demo is a taste of what is to come, and while we'd love to reveal everything to you already, we did pack in as much as we could without giving away too much either.\n\nMess with and break the game! There's a good lot to discover in this demo. All of us have been pretty addicted to Stabjack, so we hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\n\nOf course, if you have any feedback or just want to join our community, we have a \u003clink=\"Discord\"\u003e\u003ccolor=lightblue\u003e\u003cu\u003eDiscord\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/color\u003e\u003c/link\u003e.
